Changes in Version 1.1-1

  o A new improved version of the "plm" package is available
    from CRAN (version 1.1-1). This fixes a bug in the summary()
    of "plm" objects, see the vignette/errata for details.
    Furthermore, there is now a vcovHC() method for "panelmodel"
    objects: It gives equivalent results to pvcovHC() but
    is now the recommended user interface and hence used
    in the examples of some manual pages (see e.g. ?Fatalities).


Changes in Version 1.1-0

  o Some variable names in the PSID1976 (aka Mroz) data
    have been renamed: "earnings" is now called "wage"
    (to avoid confusion with other data sets), the previous
    variable "wage" is renamed as "repwage" (reported wage).
    Currently, "earnings" is kept; it will be removed in future
    releases.

  o Documentation of the Grunfeld data has been enhanced and
    updated. Much more details are available in a recent
    technical report: Kleiber and Zeileis (2008), "The
    Grunfeld Data at 50", available from http://epub.wu-wien.ac.at/.
    
  o Multinomial logit examples using Yves Croissant's "mlogit"
    package have been added for the TravelMode and BankWages
    data sets.

  o Vignette/errata updated.
